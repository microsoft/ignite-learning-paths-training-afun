# Azure Identity Fundamentals

## Session Abstract
Identity is the core of most workloads in Azure, and Tailwind Traders wants to implement Azure Active Directory in a way that correctly meshes their on-premises identities with those required in the cloud. In this session, learn the difference between authentication and authorization, as well as different identity models. Then, dive into the benefits of conditional access and multi-factor authentication (MFA) and wrap up with a demo showing you how to implement these types of extra protection.
