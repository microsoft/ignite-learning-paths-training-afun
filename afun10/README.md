 [![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-AFUN-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths-training-afun)
 
## Session Abstract

New developers at Tailwind Traders have a saying about learning our technology platform: "it's like drinking from a firehose." Indeed, learning all Microsoft Azure services can seem overwhelming – especially if you're unfamiliar with Azure or the cloud in general. In this session, we start at the beginning, introducing Azure and the core concepts that are foundational to our cloud platform. We start with a discussion of what cloud computing is and what Azure offers you and your team. We then take a look at basic services and features, setting up an account and subscription along the way. Finally, we tour the Azure Portal and do a quick overview of the resources available and what they do.
