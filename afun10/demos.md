# Demos Notes

 ## Demo 1 - Browse the Azure Portal

> ðŸ’¡ You must have completed the [deployment](deployment.md) before attempting to do the demo.


 * Walk-through the portal. Show the new design (including where the sidebar is now hidden by default) and show different resources and resource types.

 * Click on the Cloud Shell icon and show the Azure Cloud Shell and how it can be used with Bash or PowerShell. Show ```code .``` if you want to show off the very basic Monaco integration (not to be confused with VS Online)

 * You can also choose to show the Azure CLI using the Windows Terminal (Cloud Shell or via the PowerShell Az extension) or on macOS/Linux (using the Azure CLI package)

 **Note:** Make sure you're using the "public" view of the Portal and not the Preview. This is the Public Portal URL https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#home

 ## Demo 2 - Create a VM in the Portal and in the Cloud Shell

> ðŸ’¡ You must have completed the [deployment](deployment.md) before attempting to do the demo.

1. Load the Azure Portal
2. Click on "Create a Resource"
3. Choose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
4. Choose the proper subscription (most-likely, "Ignite the Tour)
5. Choose the existing resource group, "AFUN10" -- if this resource group does not exist for some reason, create it now.
6. Give the VM a unique name i.e. twt-[CITY] or ignite-tour-[CITY]
7. Choose the region, select US East US (this is the region of the AFUN10 resource group)
8. Select the Ubuntu LTS Image -- scroll through the options to show other image choices
9. For size, allow the default D2s v3 Option to exist -- you can show the other sizes available if you want
10. For auth type, you can choose a password or an SSH key, I prefer an SSH key. Enter in whatever username you want.
11. In the SSH field, enter in an SSH public key pre-generated (if you're using a snippet) OR fill out the password field instead
12. Choose your public inbound ports. By default, port 22 (SSH) is selected, I often select Port 80 and Port 443 for HTTP and HTTPS
13. Click Next and go to the Disks section
14. In Disks, select either Premium or Standard SSD (leaving the default is fine)
15. Click Next: Networking
16. Keep the Networking settings as default -- show that you could choose an existing virtual network if you wanted
17. Click Next:Management
18. Again, keep all options as default
19. Click Next: Advanced
20. Keep all default options -- at your discretion, show off the Extension options and the cloud-init options
21. Click Next:Tags
22. Explain how tagging works, do not fill out tags
23. Click Next: Review + Create
24. Ensure settings are correct, show how to download the ARM template, click the create button

 While the VM is being created in the Portal, click on the CloudShell button at the top of the Portal

1. Login, ensure you are in the same subscription as where you created your last VM
2. Choose "Bash" if you are given an option
3. Type in the following command (using a text snippet is highly recommended) 
    ``` shell 
    az vm create \
    --resource-group AFUN10 \
    --name myVM \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys
    ```
4. Execute the snippet, explain what each command does -- i.e., creates a VM in resource group AFUN10, with the name myVM using the UbuntuLTS image with an admin username of azureuser and a generated SSH key
5. Watch as the VM is created
6. After the VM is created, go to the Azure Portal and show the resources in AFUN10, showing that both virtual machines now exist.
