# Prerequisites for reproducing live

- If you are a Microsoft FTE, contact Sonia Cuff for the credentials to an existing Cost Management Demo account (the one used in the recordings). This account already has data for cost managament (consumption, tags & recommendations).
- Or you will need access to an Azure subscription that has recent usage of Azure services (preferably virtual machines), with at least Cost Management Reader privileges.
- The recorded demos use an Enterprise Agreement tenancy, but you can vary this and use a Pay as you Go or other subscription type (eg MSDN).
- Some resources with recent usage must use Azure tags for the Azure Budgets demo. The recording uses the environment tag name with a dev tag value.
- You’ll also need at least one virtual machine which has been underutilized relevant to it’s size, to generate an Azure Advisor recommendation (or choose another Azure Advisor recommendation which suits).
- If your Azure login shows the Preview portal by default, instead use https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#home
