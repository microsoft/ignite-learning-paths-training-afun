### Post-Deployment Steps

#### OneDrive Connection

From the Azure Portal open the Azure Logic App blade, and click click **Edit** in the top menu. 

There is currently two boxes: an HTTP Trigger, and a OneDrive action. Before we can try it we need to give access to the Azure Logic App to your OneDrive.

> Note that there is a little icon ⚠️ to show that this action required our attention

Click on the second Box, named Connections. There is a message saying: "Invalid connection". It's normal it wasn't configured. Let's fix that. Click on the **Add new** button. This will popup a login window, where you will need to enter your OneDrive credentials.

By default, the Azure Logic App while creates the file into the folder */IgniteDemo*. If you don't have it, create it from your OneDrive or select another folder.

> You should create a */IgniteDemo* folder closer as possible to the Root. Also if you prefer you can use DropBox or another folder online service.

You are now ready to present.



## **IMPORTANT:** When you are done

Be sure to delete the resources when you have completed the presentation. It can be done by the portal or with Azure CLI.

``` az cli
az group delete --name <resource group name> --yes --no-wait
```

It will take several minutes, but by deleting the entire resource group, all resources associated with the demo environment will be destroyed.
