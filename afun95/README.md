## Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders is curious about the concept behind "serverless" computing – the idea that they can run small pieces of code in the cloud or workflow, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. In this session, we’ll cover the world of Azure Functions, starting with an explanation of the servers behind serverless, exploring the languages and integrations available, and ending with a demo of using Azure Logic Apps and Azure Function working together.

## Get Started

This training repository is divided in to the following sections:

| [Slides](#slides) | [Demos](demos/readme.md) | [Deployment](deployment/README.md) | 
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------
| 41 slides - 20 minutes, | 4 demos - 25 minutes, | 1 automated deployment

 [Full-length video can be viewed here](https://globaleventcdn.blob.core.windows.net/assets/afun/afun95/afun95-full-length.mp4).

## Slides

THe slides are divises in four sections:

 Section                    | Slides        | Notes
----------------------------|---------------|------
What’s serverless?          | 4-18          | It starts agnostic, then at slide 14 is Azure focus
Azure Logic App             | 19-24, 25     | 
Azure Function              | 26-32, 33, 34 |
How it all works together   | 35            |
