# AFUN95: Figuring Out Azure Functions​  

## Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders is curious about the concept behind "serverless" computing – the idea that they can run small pieces of code in the cloud, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. In this session, we’ll cover the world of Azure Functions, starting with an explanation of the servers behind serverless, exploring the languages and integrations available, and ending with a demo of when to use Logic Apps and Microsoft Flow.  

The session [Ignite Learning Paths - AFUN95](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths/tree/master/afun/afun95).

## Get Started

This training repository is divided in to the following sections:

| [Slides](#slides) | [Demos](demos/readme.md) | [Deployment](deployment/README.md) | 
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------
| 41 slides - 25 minutes, | 3 demos - 20 minutes, | 1 automated deployment

 [Full-length video can be viewed here (Coming Soon..)](https://coming.soon).

## Slides

THe slides are divises in four sections:

 Section                    | Slides        | Notes
----------------------------|---------------|------
What’s serverless?          | 4-18          | It starts agnostic, then at slide 14 is Azure focus
Azure Logic App and Flow    | 19-24, 25     | 
Azure Function              | 26-32, 33, 34 |
How it all works together   | 35            |

### Timing

| Time        | Description 
--------------|-------------
0:00 – 5:00   | Introduction / What is Serverless 
5:00 – 10:00  | Overview of Azure Functions Ecosystem (Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow) 
10:00 – 15:00 | Microsoft Flow and Logic Apps 
15:00 – 20:00 | Logic Apps **Demo** 
20:00 – 25:00 | Azure Functions Overview (Languages, Pricing, Integration) 
25:00 – 35:00 | Overview of creating an Azure Function in JavaScript **Demo**
40:00 – 45:00 | Deploying an Azure Function to Azure using GitHub **Demo**
40:00 – 45:00 | Using Azure Functions, Logic Apps and Microsoft Flow together 

## Deployment / Preparation

The following steps are necessary to prepare for AFUN95 demos.

- Until the magic button is done we need to do a few steps manually
- Create an Node.js Function App
- Create an Empty Logic App

### Suggested Presentation SetUp
 
 You should have a few things open a ready: 

 - PowerPoint
 - Browser Tab - Portal Azure - Dashboard/ home
 - Browser Tab - Portal Azure - Function App (with out any Functions)
 - Browser Tab - Portal Azure - Logic App Overview blade 
 - Browser Tab - GitHub - this document. (https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths/tree/afun95/fun/afun95)
 - ZoomIt (or another application that zoom your screen) should be running
 

## Demos

> What's Here? Pre-delivery preparation, stage ready videos, required files (such as JSON templates), and walk-through videos

Detailed explanations of each demonstration associated with this presentation can be found in this section. There are 3 "live from stage" technical demonstrations that utilize a number of tools both in and out of Azure. [You can get a high level overview of the tools and how we will be using them here](demos/readme.md).
