# AFUN30: Discovering Azure tooling and utilities

  [![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-AFUN-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths-training-afun)

## Session Abstract

Microsoft Azure allows you to build your applications with the full power and resilience of the cloud. But, how do you do that? In this session, we show you the tools that Tailwind Traders uses on a daily basis, including the Visual Studio Code editor and its Azure extension. We also introduce you to the Azure Cloud Shell, which allows you to work with Azure resources - without the need for the Portal. Finally, we show you how Azure Resource Management (ARM) templates save you time and help you automate infrastructure, reducing the chance of errors that come with manual human input.
