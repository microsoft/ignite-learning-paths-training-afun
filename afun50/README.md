# AFUN50: Storing data in Azure

 [![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-AFUN-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths-training-afun/)

 
## Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders deals with gigantic amounts of data, continually pouring in from sources such as sales, marketing, and fulfillment. In the past, the only choice they had was to put it all into a relational database in a data center. However, by moving to Microsoft Azure, they can now optimize their data storage with increased scalability and resilience. In this session, we will introduce the various storage options available on Azure, from blob to SQL databases. You’ll also learn about Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, multi-model database.
