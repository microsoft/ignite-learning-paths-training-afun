# Demos

## Demo 1 - Storage Account Demo

> üí° You must have completed the [deployment](deployment.md) before attempting to do the demo.

We are going to go into the web portal for this demo, but everything we are going to do in the portal we could do in multiple different ways. We could use the Azure APIs to create the storage account, we could use an ARM template, which is the Azure native Infrastructure as Code option, or we could even use a command line. Yes, in case you haven‚Äôt gotten to play around with it, Azure has a command line that you can launch from a web browser, or even directly from your OS. You can also use tools like Visual Studio and VScode to configure them.

But, for us, we choose the portal. We log in and you can see the home screen here. For most things in Azure if I want to create a new resource I start here, and click Create a Resource. This takes us to the Marketplace, and you can see our most popular options. You‚Äôll notice that each of these services on the right has a ‚ÄúQuickstart Tutorial‚Äù link available, which will take you directly to the documentation for that service. There, you‚Äôll find everything you need to get up and running quickly. They are usually 5-minutes articles, sometimes videos as well, that go over how to deploy and configure the service you have selected. You‚Äôll also see specific help depending on the method you are using to create the resource. Here we have the portal, PowerShell, The Azure CLI, and help if you are using the .NET, Java, Python or JavaScript SDKs. We‚Äôve spent so much time and energy on making it so you don‚Äôt have to dig very far to find the information you need to get started, and all of these documentation pages are able to be edited by customers directly, so if there‚Äôs something else you need, or if something doesn‚Äôt work as expected, you can contact the documentation teams directly to get it updated.

Here we go and create a new storage account.

We have to add some information in, and it‚Äôs basically the same for any new Azure services you deploy. You need to choose the subscription you want to use, and you need to either choose an existing resource group or create a new one. Resource groups are collections of different kinds of resources and you can choose how you want group things. Some customers group them by project, some group them by physical location, some customers who are spinning up environments for testing will use the name of the test run to keep things simple. Whatever you choose it goes here. 

You can choose from any Azure Region, and the type of performance level needed. Under ‚ÄúReplication‚Äù we can see all the types available. We can see that in the region we have selected we do have the option to use zone-based replication!

Finally we can choose which access tier we need for this dataset. Once we are done, we click ‚Äúreview and create‚Äù. On the next screen we can review our choices and start the account creation.

After it‚Äôs complete we can look at the overview. We can see the status of the primary and secondary copies and which region they are deployed into and the replication type we selected. We can see each of the storage types we have the ability to deploy and some performance graphs that are automatically.

To the left, we have a couple of the places we can use the things we talked about earlier. We can see the access keys that are used for programmatic access to the account, and rotate them as needed. Under encryption we can see that data at rest is always encrypted, and we have the option of using our own keys if we want to. We can also do interesting things like leverage a storage account to create a static website. All you have to do is enable it and you‚Äôll get a public URL and SSL encryption for whatever content you want to upload.

Let‚Äôs go back to the overview and we‚Äôll create a basic file share. Since we just created the account, we can confirm that there aren‚Äôt any existing shares, and click the plus sign to create a new one. We‚Äôll give it a name and a quota, and in short order we can see it‚Äôs done. If we open it up, we see the options we have. We can enable backups, we can view or create snapshots, and we can look at how to connect the file system to an operating system. Since SMB supports Windows, Linux and MacOS, we have each of the commands you‚Äôd need to use to connect right here. If we look at the Windows section specifically, we can pick a drive letter we‚Äôd like to map, and then see the PowerShell command we‚Äôd use to connect and map the folder to the host. Now, multiple endpoints can see and make changes to a shared set of files. 


## Demo 2 - Cosmos DB Demo

> üí° You must have completed the [deployment](deployment.md) before attempting to do the demo.

I deployed the standalone version of the TT app, and there‚Äôs a Cosmos DB database that gets deployed as part of that, which is using the MongoDB API to store inventory data. It doesn‚Äôt really matter whether you use this or just deploy an empty Cosmos DB instance, you can do the demo either way. 

After you open up the database instance, the first thing we can see is the status of the instance. We can see whether it‚Äôs online or not, as well as the resource group and subscription being used. We can also quickly see which regions we have deployed into for both reads and writes, since those can be set manually. Finally, we have the global URI that is going to be used to access this data regardless of how many regions we have the data spread out over. 

Underneath that, we can see the list of ‚Äúcollections‚Äù or data sets that are being stored in this instance, as well as the throughput of that collection. 

We can also see some statistics that might be useful at a glance, including the number of requests, as well as a visual representation of both the storage and bandwidth billing components of the service. 

On the left menu we can access more things that will be helpful for us. We can open the Connection String section and see both the read-write and read-only keys, as well as the connection information to primary and secondary copies. 

The left menu is also where you can set up the global replication that we know is such a huge benefit of Cosmos DB. We can see the map of all the Azure regions and see what locations we have data in at any point in time. We can also see whether multi-region writes are enabled, and see a list of the regions being used. If we wanted to copy this database to new regions, we‚Äôd simply select them on the map.  Here we‚Äôll add the North Europe, West Europe, Hong Kong and Sydney regions to the two we already had, and when we click save, Azure will start the process of replicating the data over, and once that process is complete, add those regions to the load balancer and let customers in those geographies start accessing their local instances. 

Finally, we can actually browse the data we are storing directly from the Azure portal. We can use the Data Explorer and drill down into each of the stored documents to see the records themselves. This database is storing inventory data for Tailwind Traders, and we can see the JSON entries for each product the company sells. This data is actually being accessed through the MongoDB API, so the application THINKS it‚Äôs talking to a MongoDB instance even though we are running it on a platform with significantly more scale and capabilities.
