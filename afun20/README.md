## Session Abstract

Now that Tailwind Traders has decided to take the journey into the cloud, they need to understand how their applications and services communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. In this session, we cover the basics of Azure networking: what it is, how it differs from on-premises, and how to take full advantage of its capabilities. We then learn how the virtual machines in your new network can communicate with each other over the internet and our on-premises network, using Virtual Network Peering, site-to-site VPN, and Azure ExpressRoute. Finally, we discuss how you to optimize, using Azure Traffic Manager.
